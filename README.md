# LDO Picobilical  
The Picobilical by LDO is a PCB mod designed specifically for the Voron0 series printers. The Picobilical is based on [V0-Umbilical](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Hardware/tree/master/V0-Umbilical) by timmit99 and retains its original advantages while introducing new features: 
- Rear mounted toolhead PCB simplifies toolhead wiring and maintenance.
- On-board RP2040 microcontroller frees up ports in the main controller while greatly simplifying wiring.
- Integrated 24V to 5V buck converter with max 5A output eliminates the need for an external 5V buck converter for the Raspberry Pi.
- Three independent neopixel ports.
- Selectable supply voltage (24V or 5V) for part fan and hotend fan.
- On-board thermistor for chamber temperature monitoring.
- Optional filament sensor input.
